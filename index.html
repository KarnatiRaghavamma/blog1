        The Trinity of Carnatic Music, also known as the Three Jewels of Carnatic Music, refers to the outstanding trio
        of composer-musicians of Carnatic music in the 18th century—Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar, and Syama Sastri.
        Prolific in composition, the Trinity of Carnatic music is known for creating a new era in the history of
        carnatic music by bringing about a noticeable change in what was the existing carnatic music tradition.
        Compositions of the Trinity of Carnatic music are recognized as being distinct in style, and original in
        handling ragas. All three composers were born in Thiruvarur, formerly part of Thanjavur District in Tamilnadu.<br/>Like all art forms in Indian culture, Indian classical music is believed to be a divine art form which originated from the devas and devis (Hindu gods and goddesses) and is venerated as symbolic of nāda brāhman.Ancient treatises also describe the connection of the origin of the svaras, or notes, to the sounds of animals and birds and man's effort to simulate these sounds through a keen sense of observation and perception. The Samaveda, which is believed to have laid the foundation for Indian classical music, consists of hymns from the Rigveda, set to musical tunes which would be sung using three to seven musical notes during Vedic yajnas.The Yajurveda, which mainly consists of sacrificial formulae, mentions the veena as an accompaniment to vocal recitations.References to Indian classical music are made in many ancient texts, including epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. The Yajnavalkya Smriti states, "vīṇāvādana tattvajñaḥ śrutijātiviśāradaḥ tālajñaścāprayāsena mokṣamārgaṃ niyacchati" (The one who is well versed in veena, one who has the knowledge of srutis and one who is adept in tala, attains liberation (moksha) without doubt").Contemporray Carnatic music is based on musical concepts (including svara, raga, and tala) that were described in detail in several ancient works, particularly the Bharata's Natya Shastra and Cilappatikaram by Ilango Adigal<br/>

    <h2>Instruments in Carnatic Music</h2>
    <p align="justify" contenteditable="">The violin holds a place in the world of music as it produces deeply moving
        and soulful melodies. While its origins can be traced back to century Italy it has undergone adaptations and
        refinements to suit styles of music. Eminent Carnatic violinists such as Lalgudi Gopala Iyer Jayaraman have made
        contributions to this genration<br />The mridangam, a percussion instrument rooted in music plays a role in
        creating captivating rhythms and beats. It is frequently accompanied by instruments such as the ghatam and
        kanjira to create compositions. The Mridangamela festival, conceptualized by Korambu Subrahmanian Namboodiri
        continues to nurture the traditions associated with this drumming art form.<br />
